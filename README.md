# ðŸ›’ Basic Sales Summary Using SQLite and Python

This project demonstrates how to use **SQLite** within a **Python (Jupyter)** environment to extract and visualize basic sales data.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

A small, in-memory SQLite database is created with a `sales` table that contains:

- `product` (e.g., Laptop, Mouse)
- `quantity` sold
- `price` per unit

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook or `.py` script)
- `sqlite3` â€“ lightweight SQL database engine built into Python
- `pandas` â€“ for data querying and display
- `matplotlib` â€“ for basic visualization

---

## ðŸ§ª Process Overview

1. Create SQLite database and `sales` table
2. Insert mock product sales data
3. Run SQL query to calculate:
   - Total quantity sold per product
   - Total revenue per product (`quantity * price`)
4. Load SQL results into pandas DataFrame
5. Print the result
6. Plot a bar chart of revenue by product

---

## ðŸ’¡ SQL Used

```sql
SELECT 
    product,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_qty,
    ROUND(SUM(quantity * price), 2) AS revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```

## ðŸ“œ Files Included

- `sales_data.db` â€” SQLite database file
- `sales_summary.py` â€” Python script to generate analysis
- `sales_chart.png` â€” Bar chart of product revenue
